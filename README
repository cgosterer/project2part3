Included Files: elevatorCalls.c, elevator.h, elevator.c, floors.c, eleproc.c, init.c, Makefile
Description: This kernel module simulates an elevator and adds system calls to activate and the elevator, as well as a proc file to display data on the elevator.  Elevator schedule uses a SCAN algorithm.
File Descriptions:
elevatorCalls.c - Defines the syscall wrappers, must be compiled in the kernel
elevator.h - Header file contains shared function prototypes between other submodules and datatypes for elevatorState and Passenger
elevator.c - Stores information on elevator state, spawns kthread to run elevator, and contains scheduling algorithm
floors.c - Sets up datastructures to hold waiting passengers, manages access to said datastructures, and defines cleanup procedures for said datastructures
eleproc.c - Sets up proc file
init.c - Contains module_init and module_exit function definitions
Makefile - Makes the files
Compilation Instructions: elevatorCalls.c must be compiled into the kernel.  `make` will compile all other files into elevatorSim.ko file, which can be loaded and unloaded like any other module
